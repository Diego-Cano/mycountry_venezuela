                    <h2>Crisis</h2>
                    <p>The Crisis in Venezuela during the Bolivarian Revolution is an ongoing socioeconomic and political crisis that began in Venezuela on 2 June 2010 during the presidency of Hugo Chávez and continues into the presidency of Nicolás Maduro. It is marked by hyperinflation, escalating starvation, disease, crime and mortality rates, resulting in massive emigration from the country. According to economists interviewed by The New York Times, the situation is the worst economic crisis in Venezuela's history and the worst facing a country in peace time since the mid-20th century and is more severe than that of the United States during the Great Depression, of the 1985–1994 Brazilian economic crisis, or of the 2008–2009 hyperinflation in Zimbabwe.</p>
